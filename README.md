Objective

To classify the text documents to 20 different types of newsgroup.

Dataset

Downloaded dataset from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-11/www/naive-bayes.html.
Divided them into 50% train data and 50% test data.
Path for train=’Train\Class\text_file’

Solution 

Built a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier and applied on test text documents to classify them to different newsgroup.
